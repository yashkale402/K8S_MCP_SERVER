    spec:
      containers:
      - name: shop-container
        image: your-shop-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
          limits:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "200m"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
```

### 🔧 Services
Enable communication inside and outside the cluster with AWS Q networking optimizations.

```yaml
# AWS Q enhanced service configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: shop-service
  namespace: ecommerce
  labels:
    managed-by: aws-q
spec:
  selector:
    app: shop
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  type: NodePort
  sessionAffinity: ClientIP
```
